        <p className="mt-2">The Grand Theft Auto series, developed by Rockstar Games, is one of the most iconic and commercially successful franchises in video game history. Since its debut in 1997, GTA has pushed the boundaries of open-world game design, storytelling, and satire. With each new installment, from the 2D landscapes of the original to the sprawling 3D world of GTA V, the series has consistently raised the bar for immersive and interactive entertainment. Grand Theft Auto V, released in 2013, has sold over 190 million copies, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time. The upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI is poised to continue this legacy, promising to be the most ambitious and technologically advanced title in the series yet.</p>
